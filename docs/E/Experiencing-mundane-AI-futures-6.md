About the Authors:

**Matthew Pilling** is a Research Associate in the in the exploratory design-led research studio Imagination Lancaster. His research explores the role of design in futures thinking, with a particular focus on socio-technical imaginaries and futures visioning.

**Paul Coulton** is the Chair of Speculative and Game Design in the open and exploratory design-led research studio Imagination Lancaster. He uses a research through design approach to create fictional representations of future worlds in which emerging technologies have become mundane.

**Tom Lodge** is a Horizon Research Fellow with expertise in networking technologies, interaction design, and data visualisation. He has led technical development on a number of EPSRC and EU-funded projects, including the user centred networking project (UCN).

**Andy Crabtree** is Professor of Computing at the University of Nottingham, though a sociologist by background and design ethnographer who played a formative role in developing the Human Data Interaction framework.

**Alan Chamberlain** is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham. He uses qualitative human-centred approaches based in ethnography to support the design process and to understand human computer interaction (in context).
