## III. SITUATING THE BROAD READING WITHIN MODELS OF CHANGE
Change—even revolutionary change—is more likely to succeed if it follows a path that has yielded success in the past. In asking whether a proposal for an expanded federal role in telehealth regulation is likely to succeed, a comparison to three different paths, or models, that earlier expansions of federal regulation in health care have employed may be instructive. Before proceeding, it is necessary to state a few assumptions: that the proposal’s goal is the creation of a federal-based regulatory regime, that demand for telehealth will remain strong, and that telehealth will represent a large portion of health care delivery from this point on. <sup>26</sup> Under these assumptions, a comprehensive approach will necessitate a large federal presence. It is also necessary to admit that many of the historical antecedents to which we might turn for insights are uneasy fits. The 20th century saw several dramatic expansions of federal authority over medical products—biologics, drugs, and medical devices. And from the mid-twentieth century to the present, we have seen expansions of the federal government’s role in regulating and providing health care insurance. Although telehealth regulation involves products and insurance, *A Telehealth Explosion* is really discussing the regulation of a mode of delivery of health care services that is facilitated by new technologies. Recognizing this, I argue that the approach that

<sup>26</sup> The assumptions concerning the future demand for and the portion of delivery that will be supplied by telehealth seem reasonable. Before the pandemic, telehealth was the fastest growing mode of health care delivery and projected to account for $64 billion in annual health care spending by 2025. Hoffman, supra note 3, at 237-38. More recent projections have gone as high as $250 billion annually, although these have subsequently been the subject of cautions.

Congress and HHS took in regulating electronic health information in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides the most relevant model for comparison.

In one model of expanding the federal role in regulating aspects of health care, Congress has responded to highly publicized tragedies by defining an entire category of products, over which a federal agency will be given jurisdiction, and establishing a detailed statutory regime to be implemented by that agency. Early in the twentieth century, Congress rushed the Biologics Control Act into law after highly publicized episodes in which contaminated batches of the smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin killed scores of people.<sup>27</sup> Congress passed the original Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) in 1938, shortly after the Elixer Sulfanilamide event in which more than a hundred people, mostly children, died from the toxic effects of a never-tested solvent used to dissolve a sulfa drug.<sup>28</sup> And Congress passed the Medical Device Amendments in 1976 in the wake of high-profile device problems such as the sepsis, spontaneous abortions, and maternal deaths caused by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device.<sup>29</sup>

Superficially, the COVID–19 crisis, with over 822,000 deaths in the United States to date,<sup>30</sup> would seem to provide a close analogy. But each of the earlier instances differs from the COVID–19 crisis in a critical way: In response to the earlier crises, Congress responded by regulating the cause of the crisis (contaminated vaccines, untested drugs, defective devices), whereas regulating telehealth does not involve regulating the cause of the crisis (the SARS-CoV

2 virus). The direct relationship between the harm-causing agent and the regulatory response, which might break through legislative logjams, is not present.

In another model of federal expansion, in response to decades-long efforts to expand health care coverage, Congress created sources of funding and an extensive administrative bureaucracy to administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs and various aspects of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). <sup>31</sup> It is difficult to argue that telehealth presents the same kind of long-term pent-up demand that preceded the creation of federal health care coverage for the elderly through Medicare or the expansions to coverage through the ACA.

Thus, the social conditions that these models have been used to address are not close matches to those that are present in this moment. Nor are these the models that *A Telehealth Explosion* is employing. Creating a detailed statutory regime akin to those in the Biologics Control Act, the FDCA, and the Medical Device Amendments is not the model that Professor Farringer is following. And although I read *A Telehealth Explosion* to advocate a strongly federal-centered regulatory approach, creating the equivalent of the Medicare, Medicaid, or ACA type program to provide coverage for telehealth services is not the model either.

Far more relevant is the HIPAA model. By the early 1990s, the promise of a new technology—electronic storage and transmission of health records—to improve health care had become apparent. At the same time, the dangers of electronically stored records, particularly the danger of compromised privacy, had become apparent as well.<sup>32</sup> And the existence of a tangled web of state-level privacy protections threatened to hamper the development of this promising

new component of health care. In response, Congress included in the HIPAA statute a subtitle intended 

> to improve . . . the health care system, by encouraging the development of a health information system through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information.<sup>33</sup>

The statute included a basic set of definitions establishing who was to be subjected to regulation and the object of that regulation, but ultimately left the development of the details to HHS.

Under a broad reading of *A Telehealth Explosion,* HIPAA provides a reasonable analogy to the key proposal for Congress and HHS to “establish a definitional framework for telehealth services.” <sup>34</sup> Many of the same conditions are present now. Thanks in part to the pandemic, the promise of a new technology—telehealth—has now been amply demonstrated. As the examples of Zoom bombing have illustrated, the risks of this new technology are also now apparent. And the impediment that the existing tangled web of regulations poses to the realization of the technology’s full potential is undeniable. In addition, the goal of encouraging the development of an exciting new technology is analogous. To be sure, the Privacy Rule has no shortage of detractors. But as a model for expanding the federal presence in health care regulation, HIPAA has been a success: There is no doubt that the terms, the structure, the rules, and the objectives of privacy regulation have been set by Congress and HHS.

Another adage that is particularly relevant in the COVID–19 era is that “uncertainty is the only certainty.” <sup>35</sup> Whether demand for telehealth will remain strong, whether clinical data will continue to support its use, and—relevant here—whether Professor Farringer’s approach to the regulatory barriers that have stymied the development of telehealth will be adopted all remain uncertain. But in the effort to create a solution to a complex problem, adopting a model for change that has succeeded in the past is a promising choice.
