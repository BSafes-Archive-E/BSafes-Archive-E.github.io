## 2. HDI ≠ HCD
Whilst the term HDI might suggest an alignment with the approaches associated with Human Centred Design (HCD), which seeks to maintain the perspective on the human-being as the central consideration, we instead align this research with more-than HCD considerations, which see the human as just another ‘*thing*’ within hyper-connected and data-mediated assemblages (Coulton & Lindley, 2019). For example, this approach sees the things within such networks as much more than their physical forms and extend to include algorithms, humans, data, business models, regulations, climate, nefarious actants, etc. Each of these things brings with it independent-but-interdependent motivations and perspectives.

The particular More-Than-Human approach presented here is based on readings of contemporary Object-Oriented Philosophies discussed by Graham Harman (2018), Timothy Morton (2013), and Ian Bogost (2012) among others. The keystone to our notion of More-Than-Human perspectives is the use of Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO), and principally through its rejection of correlationism. This manifests as the proposition that perspectives derived by human minds and bodies are not the only ones worth considering. It is particularly challenging for many technology designers because of the ubiquity and dogmatic predilection for HCD in commercial settings and education alike (Coulton & Lindley, 2019). Although we are in effect problematising HCD, our argument is primarily against how it manifests itself in designed artefacts, and we do this to promote equality for outcomes that address the common good as well as outcomes which promote the interests of the individual.

Beyond the dismissal of correlationism, the particular interpretation of OOO has been most influenced by Ian Bogost and his expositions in Alien Phenomenology (2012). While Bogost’s construction of OOO builds on the work of others, his presentation is particularly accessible and relevant for design-led inquiry (perhaps due to his background as a game designer). Bogost coins a series of OOO-related neologisms (e.g. Unit Operations, Tiny Ontologies, Carpentry) and one of these, the idea of *Ontography*, is particularly useful when considering HDI.

Bogost’s adoption of ontography is an inscriptive strategy that exposes the abundance of units, their operations, and their inter-object relations – it is a catalogue of being:

> “Ontography is a practice that exposes the couplings and chasms between units, where revelation invites speculation” (2012).

The experiential platform (in this case, our caravan) can therefore be viewed as a physical and experiential ontography, providing a lens through which we as designers, can begin to design and explore pathways for legibility, agency, and negotiability. In OOO, ontography is the examination of ontographs or collections of ontological modalities as possible relationships an object or indeed an assemblage of objects may take. Bogost suggests a perspective of ontography as a record of the “*things within*” (2012). This recording of objects can then be defined further by their “*collocation*” to not only the things within the ontograph, but also those around it (2012). Here, it is also useful to draw on Karen Barad’s consideration of agency not as a property but as something which emerges from how entangled agencies relate to each other (Barad, 2007). In ontography we attempt to map the ontologies of relationships between human and non-human things within networked assemblages and highlight both interdependent relationships and independent perspectives.

For example, Figure 1 is an ontograph highlighting some of the possible relationships formed for a voice assistant system such as Alexa or Google Home. These interdependent relationships serve to highlight different parts of the assemblage, and how they might represent independent-but-interdependent perspectives. For example, viewpoint 1 represents the user perspective as might be considered with ‘HCD’ approaches. The user is focussed only on the task of interacting with the voice  assistant and the remaining system is basically invisible to them. If we shift focus to viewpoint 2, considering the system from the service provider’s perspective, whilst this also includes the user and their device, this viewpoint is heavily influenced by their business model which implies the user is seen primarily as a means of providing data both to improve the Natural Language Processing element of the service, but also to infer behavioural patterns of the user which can be used to profile the user for better targeted advertising (this data, in its own right, may then also be traded on the open market). Viewpoint 3 presents a climate change perspective that allows the embodied carbon involved in production, operation, and shipping to be considered even if the device not manufactured in its country of operation.

Having presented the theoretical perspective that influenced this research we will now present our research through design account of creating the mundane AI experience.
