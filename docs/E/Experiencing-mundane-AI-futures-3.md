## 3. Future mundane experiential platform
The approach to the experience is that of an experiential future using the design fiction as worldbuilding approach (Coulton *et al*., 2017) which diegetically situates audiences directly within the same artificial world, in order to better explore and experience how today’s emerging technologies may become tomorrow’s mundane normality.

Whilst it would be possible to deploy such a mundane future experience in someone’s actual home or simulate a home environment at a university or gallery this would limit the potential audience with whom we could engage. We therefore decided to recreate a home environment as a mobile platform. This manifested as a teardrop caravan, shown in Figure 2, housing a familiar representation of a (UK) living room (i.e., a sofa, TV, lamps, etc.) along with integrated smart devices and support for monitoring and capturing the experiences in an unobtrusive manner.

This project is a development of The Living Room of the Future project (Coulton et al., 2019), which was previously installed at several galleries across the UK. Whilst the creation of a mobile research platform permits engagement with a large and varied audience, it also creates a unique set of challenges, primarily the extremely tight spatial constraints. Previous installations had taken place in spaces measuring approximately 10m2 , whereas the caravan measures only a little over 5m2 . The primary design and fabrication challenges that this research platform presented can be explained using three key factors. Firstly, the experience is reliant on a series of networked electronic devices, many of which require a specific relationship with the audience and must be positioned accordingly. Secondly, it is necessary that the interior of the caravan be flexible and adaptable to allow the integration of not only pre-identified electronic devices, but that it also provide the opportunity for additional new and emerging devices to be added for future iterations or adaptations to the experience. Thirdly, due to this being a mobile platform, everything must be securely installed or fully integrated within the interior. It is important however that devices do not disappear from view, as suggested by ‘ubiquitous computing’ but rather, and in stark contrast, that their behaviour, particularly in relation to data, are made legible without being overtly attention grabbing.

We began by considering the overall experience and the role that each connected device would play. This allowed us to produce a hierarchy of needs to guide the layout and design of the caravan. The most important factor in creating an immersive experience is ensuring the audience is placed in the most appropriate and effective position, with the experience then being designed around them. As this would primarily be an audio-visual experience, the audience would therefore need to be positioned with an unobstructed view of the main screen. Despite the small form of the caravan, it is possible for three audience members to be seated at the rear, and each have an optimum viewing distance and viewing angle to the screen positioned directly opposite, as shown in Figure 3. With the audience position decided, we could then begin to consider the positioning for each of the additional interactive devices. Knowing that there would likely be additional upgrades and additions to this experience, the construction of the interior space was carefully considered to provide the maximum possible flexibility. This was achieved by building a hollow structural framework, as shown in Figure 4, which would allow electronic devices to be installed in the most appropriate and effective position.

The primary audio and visual devices are the television, active speaker system and controllable RGB lighting. These provide the main body of the experience, which is centered around a short film, offering multiple endings which are selected based on data derived from the audience’s actions throughout the experience. The second most important element are the speakers, which are positioned in a 5.1 configuration. The center speaker sits directly below the television, with two additional speakers sitting either side of the screen. A further two are positioned behind the seating at the rear, with a subwoofer mounted below the central seat. This arrangement was chosen to provide an immersive soundscape and allow for experimentation with directional sound in future experiences. Controllable Internet of Things (IoT) lighting was installed along the rear panel behind the seating, underneath the seating and along the top of the front paneling. This not only provided lighting for the internal space, but also enables us to control the lighting colour and hue, acting as a visual display of the ‘networkification’ of devices and data in response to participant interaction.

With the positioning of the primary elements for this experience decided, the additional complimentary devices could then be considered, using the same process of defining their hierarchy of spatial needs to inform their optimum location within the space. The diagram shown in Figure 5., indicates the chosen locations for each of the additional devices.

The audience is guided through this experience by the disembodied voice of an AI. To provide a physical representation of this we created an AI interface, resembling HAL 9000 (Kubrick, 1968) which was positioned centrally, directly below the television. While the decision to represent a sentient AI character may seem contradictory for research aiming to disambiguate the domain of human and AI interaction, the choice highlights the common misconception of AI voice assistants appearing smarter than they are (Pilling et al., 2021a). To increase the perceived capabilities of the AI guide, a webcam was installed above the television to allow facial recognition to be used as part of the experience. This provided another opportunity for making the involved technology legible and visible.

To further increase the level of immersion within the experience, and better separate the space from the external world, smart glass panels were installed over each of the four windows. When turned on, the smart glass is transparent and appears like ordinary glass, when turned off however, they become completely obscured, allowing only low-level ambient light to enter and fully obscuring visibility.

In addition to the audio-visual devices that respond to the media being shown on the television, we also installed a network connected Dyson fan, which is activated to blow hot or cold air towards the audience at appropriate times, such as during a scene depicting a cold and windy external location. We chose to use a Dyson Purifier Hot + Cold, as this provided not only the control capabilities that we required, but also had the ability to purify the air passing through it and provide data relating to its quality. Following the recent Covid19 pandemic, the ability to show that efforts were being made to clean not only the surfaces of the experience, but also the air itself, was considered a positive way to reassure visitors who were participating in the experience. This also reflects a design choice which was taken as part of the design fiction as world building approach (Coulton et al., 2017) that this research follows, reflecting the mundane reality of how these technologies become part of our everyday lives. We were also able to collect the live air quality data and using a simple graphic animation, present this on the television at the beginning of the experience for each new audience, as shown in Figure 6. The final interactive element is a receipt printer, which is installed on top of the left side panel, as shown in Figure 7. This provides a printed record of the experience, making clearly legible what data has been gathered from the audience and how it has been used to inform the experience.

To address the aforementioned issues regarding data privacy and to enable the caravan to operate at remote locations without internet connectivity, the entire experience is run on a closed network, comprised of a computer installed behind the television and a router integrated into the left side panel. This allows each of the connected devices to communicate and react to the live choices and interaction of the audience.

There are already plans to implement the use of AI icons for legibility that have been designed using OOO to consider the ontology of AI (Pilling et al., 2021b). These will be displayed on a secondary screen (integrated on the left side panelling) as and when the relevant interactions between the data being collected and AI systems occur.
