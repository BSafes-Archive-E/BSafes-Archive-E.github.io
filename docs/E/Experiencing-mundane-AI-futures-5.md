## 5. Conclusions
The colonisation of the home by smart devices has already begun and with it comes the creation of a ‘data exhaust’ that is used to feed various manifestations of AI that offer personalisation through profiling. Whilst profiling has the potential to produce many positive aspects—better health care, more immersive media experiences—it also has the potential to increase inequalities through systematized bias. It is therefore important that we develop alternative methods of design for considering technological developments that change the way we interact with them, which are currently often obfuscated and intangible. Traditional design methods enable us to see this problem from limited perspectives and do not permit consideration for the independent and interdependent relationships of networked devices.

In research we seek to re-imagine the way infused products and services are currently designed such that users are not simply treated as data-point providers but willing collaborators with the technology. This is achieved by addressing issues such as legibility, agency, and negotiability using approaches such as HDI and more-than human centred design. Whilst new challenges will emerge along the way, it is important we address the tricky elements of AI and data collection before they become highly problematic and detrimentally affect future adoption.

The development of this experiential and interactive research platform has provided unique opportunities to consider, incubate and experience different viewpoints concerning the potential effects of AI technology, data usage and IoT devices. The platform has proven to be highly engaging, offering an experience that is legible and accessible to an audience outside of the world of academia, encouraging public participation with this research and an understanding of smart devices and their operations within our own homes. Now it is ‘up and running’ we seek to deploy the caravan and explore key challenges to human data interaction in a smart world with the public at large.
