## I. A NARROW READING
In one possible reading, *A Telehealth Explosion* is an important but self-limited contribution to a growing body of scholarly work focused on telehealth regulation.<sup>3</sup> *A Telehealth Explosion* expressly disclaims a desire to offer specific proposals, instead urging that the path forward be data-driven and guided by five “key factors” that regulators and legislators should consider as they craft a new regulatory regime.<sup>4</sup> The article might be interpreted as falling within a genre of scholarship in which an author painstakingly identifies a major problem but eschews the work of fashioning a set of specific responses in favor of setting out a framework for others’ use.

Reading *A Telehealth Explosion* in this way, one particular concern is the limited focus on the quality of care that telehealth can provide. Admittedly, Professor Farringer highlights the importance of quality to state regulators, members of Congress, and the telehealth industry, <sup>5</sup> and in one key factor urges state legislators and regulators to analyze emerging data “to understand where telehealth might actually generate quality of care concerns.” <sup>6</sup> But in other places, concerns

about quality appear to go unrecognized. One example is in the discussion of whether requirements for an in-person evaluation, before care is delivered remotely, should be eliminated. The article states that “from a medical perspective” the reasons for requiring an initial in-person visit are to allow for “(1) verifying and authenticating the patient, (2) disclosing physician identity and credentials, and (3) obtaining necessary consents.” <sup>7</sup> In considering whether to eliminate these requirements, regulators should balance these concerns against the restrictions on competition and the availability of medical and pharmacy services that the requirements impose.<sup>8</sup> But this framing overlooks the critical medical reason for a face-to-face encounter from a provider’s perspective: An initial face-to-face visit allows the provider to gather clinical information that is difficult if not impossible to obtain remotely. Providers gather some of this information from subtle findings on the physical examination, such as the slight parasternal heave that may indicate an enlarged ventricle or the slight bobbing of the head (DeMusset’s sign) that may indicate severe aortic regurgitation, which even state of the art technologies cannot yet replicate remotely. <sup>9</sup> But a great deal of information is also gathered from behavioral clues that, in person, can signal discomfort with a topic, unexpressed concerns, or a tendency to minimize or dramatize complaints, but that could be missed entirely in an online encounter. An initial visit helps a clinician establish a broad and deep understanding of each patient, which can inform later remote follow-up evaluations. In some contexts, the quality of care afforded by an initial in-person evaluation must be weighed alongside the other concerns.

The discussion of the five key factors also reflects a limited focus on quality. Quality features prominently only in one of the factors: “State laws should be for the purpose of promoting efficiency and quality care, not protecting against new competitors.” <sup>10</sup> Even here, the framing emphasizes what regulation should not be (a cartelization of services) rather than how regulators should think about ensuring the quality of care. My point is that quality is a crucial factor that legislators and regulators must consider. The regulatory environment that existed before the pandemic limited the development of telehealth and, concomitantly, the development of clinical data on the outcomes that are achieved when care is delivered remotely.<sup>11</sup> This data will eventually emerge in piecemeal fashion as clinicians study the quality and value of telehealth in very specific aspects of practice.<sup>12</sup> Moving forward, it is crucial that a comprehensive regulatory approach incentivize the generation of such data and ensure that it is considered by legislators and regulators every step of the way.

A second concern focuses on how some of the proposals in *A Telehealth Explosion* could be accomplished. One of the Farringer factors urges state legislators and regulators to eliminate barriers to competition and restrictions on services. But state laws and regulations that erect barriers and impose restrictions are often deliberate features rather than inadvertent bugs. State licensure of physicians, for example, has been supported by physicians in part to limit the availability of competing medical services.<sup>13</sup> How are such laws and regulations to be eliminated

when state actors and many of their politically powerful constituents have strong reasons to maintain them?

A broader reading of the article answers this question. If *A Telehealth Explosion* were simply urging the ongoing use of data to inform policy as regulators consider the five Farringer factors, the article’s goals might be viewed as relatively modest. Such a reading would, in my view, be a mistake. *A Telehealth Explosion*, more broadly read, packs a much bigger bang. Articles that fall within that genre of scholarship referred to above—articles that identify a problem and how to think about it without actually doing the nuts-and-bolts work of solving the problem—can, if done well and if read by the right audience, define the problem and structure the approaches to solving it. These articles can thus determine the possible set of outcomes that will emerge. Professor Farringer, drawing on the history of telehealth and telehealth regulation, and looking over the lessons learned during the pandemic, is doing just this.

But it is possible to read *A Telehealth Explosion* even more broadly, not as a roadmap for evolution but rather as a plan for revolutionary change. At the same time that it disclaims the desire to offer specific proposals, *A Telehealth Explosion* offers a number of specifics in the service of creating “a comprehensive and integrative approach” to telehealth regulation. And these specifics would involve a substantial expansion of federal control. The next Part examines this broader reading.
