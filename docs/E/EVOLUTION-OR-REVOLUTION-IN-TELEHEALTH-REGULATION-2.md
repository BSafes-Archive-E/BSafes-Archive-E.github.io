## II. A BROADER READING
Telehealth is subjected to a polycentric set of regulatory inputs. As Professor Farringer summarizes, regulation before the pandemic subjected telehealth to 

> an intricate and sometimes conflicting regulatory structure involving state laws and regulations in the domicile state, state laws and regulations in other states, federal laws and regulations, federal reimbursement rules, state reimbursement rules, and all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions of commercial insurers.<sup>14</sup>

And as Part III of the article demonstrates, the federal and state responses to the pandemic, including the waivers that several federal agencies have granted, have done little to cut through this Gordian knot of conflicting statutes and regulations. Not surprisingly, then, the first key factor—really a set of concrete proposals—that Professor Farringer articulates is that it is “imperative for the federal government and states to work together to create a regulatory regime that is less complex and less confusing.” <sup>15</sup> But how is this to be done? After all, the states remain motivated, among other things, to erect barriers to entry by out-of-state providers and pharmacies.

The answer toward which *A Telehealth Explosion* appears to turn is substantially to centralize telehealth regulation under the federal government, notably the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I have noted how an article like *A Telehealth Explosion* can determine the direction and even the outcome of attempts to solve difficult problems by setting the terms of engagement. Professor Farringer’s first key factor uses this concept, arguing that “Congress, in coordination with HHS, should establish a definitional framework for telehealth services.” <sup>16</sup> Doing so would “ensure that the states and federal government are operating off the same general terms and from the same general premise.” <sup>17</sup> The federal government would thus set the terms, the structure, the rules, and the objectives for telehealth regulation. One intended result is that the “states will be better able to engage in legislative redesign that creates

consistency between the state and federal governments and among the states.” <sup>18</sup> With Congress and HHS setting the terms, this state-level redesign would create consistency with federally established terms and objectives.

Further support that *A Telehealth Explosion* sees centralizing telehealth regulation under the federal government as the best way forward is found in the suggestion that the federal government “create incentives that would encourage states to coordinate with one another and with the federal government on a basic regulatory structure for telehealth.” <sup>19</sup> How the federal government would do this is not elaborated, but the suggestion seems to encompass the possibility of a grant program in which Congress would make substantial funding available to states that adopt the HHS framework. This kind of grant program could help convert the seeming precatory language that state actors evaluate the effect of state laws and regulations into something with more bite.<sup>20</sup>

The need for the federal government to play a dominant role in a “comprehensive and integrative approach” to telehealth regulation also arises from the current regulatory regime, the deficiencies of which the remaining Farringer factors address. The second key factor is the necessity of “reducing the controls at the state and federal levels that continue to tie telehealth services to a physical location.” <sup>21</sup> This would include permitting the delivery of virtual services to a patient’s home, allowing for the delivery of care across state lines, and eliminating the requirement that the rendering physician be licensed within the state to which care is delivered.

<sup>20</sup> Congress’s power to incentivize state conduct is expansive: Congress can induce states to take actions by conditioning the receipt of funds even though directly requiring those same actions exceeds Congress’s Article I authority. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012). This power is not unlimited; in Chief Justice Roberts’s phrasing, Congress cannot create incentives that are so powerful as to amount to “a gun to the head.” *Id*. at 80.

Success would also depend on correcting reimbursement disparities, which is the subject of the fifth key factor. Although some of these steps are within the states’ authority, the states’ power to make significant change “is largely limited to either Medicaid or commercial insurance for residents of the state.” <sup>22</sup> In fact, the states almost certainly lack the authority to untether virtual care from specific locations and require payment parity of telehealth services for half of their residents.<sup>23</sup> Thus, a robust federal regulatory role is necessary to achieve the goal of expanding access. And the final key factor—examining whether laws and regulations established to protect against “fraud, waste, and abuse[,] are… successfully controlling such ills or [are] instead creating needless obstacles [to] innovation” <sup>24</sup>—is under federal control already: These obstacles are created by fraud and abuse statutes and regulations that apply to Medicare.

Thus, under a broad reading of *A Telehealth Explosion,* achieving its aspiration of fostering “a comprehensive and integrative approach” to telehealth regulation will only be possible by creating a federally based regulatory regime. Given the incentives for states to behave in a self-interested fashion and the fact that individual states are not capable of resolving many of the problems in telehealth regulation, this would appear to be an appropriate area for federal regulation. Of course, any such move toward centralization raises a host of concerns over

<sup>23</sup> According to recent Census Bureau data, 17.8% of people are covered by Medicaid. KATHERINE KEISLERSTARKEY & LISA N. BUNCH, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES: 2020, at 4 tbl.1 (2020), https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-274.pdf [https://perma.cc/82TR-QAH9]. Directly purchased plans cover 10.5%. *Id*. The state’s authority to regulate commercial insurance is sharply limited by the preemption provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which has interpreted to bar state regulation of self-funded employer sponsored health insurance. Erin C. Fuse Brown & Elizabeth Y. McCuskey, *Federalism, ERISA, and State Single-Payer Health Care,* 168 U.PA. L. REV. 389, 428-30 (2020). As a result, states may only regulate fully funded employer sponsored plans, which account for 39% of all employer sponsored plans. *Id*. The Census Bureau reported that 54.4% of people were covered by an employer sponsored plan. KEISLER-STARKEY & BUNCH, *supra* note 23, at 4 tbl.1. Thus, states can regulate the coverage of 21.3% of people. In total, states can regulate the coverage of 49.6% of people.
