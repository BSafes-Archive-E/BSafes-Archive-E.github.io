## Findings
Four main themes and eight subthemes emerged, which illuminated the experience of dating for participants (Table 2).

### Defining dating
The first dilemma that emerged from the data related to the term dating. Dating was a phenomenon the participants recognised, but that did not resonate with their experience in Ireland:

>> For me, I grew up hearing about dating on TV and for me, that didn’t exist like that whole formal I want to meet up with you thing did not happen in my life. I understood the concept of it, but that’s not what happened here (Ireland). (Cathy)

Participants felt hesitant using the word dating because it did not map onto their experience:

>> I suppose I wouldn’t name it as much, you know. I think it happens more here, but we don’t name it. I think it’s more that you’re seeing someone and then suddenly you’re going out with them. I don’t think we put the name dating on it as much, but I think I have the same idea of what it is if you get me? (Amelia)

Cathy felt that the term dating was aligned with the advent of online dating, stating, “I don’t think I or anyone that I know would have used the word dating until the whole online dating thing happened.”

“Meeting up” was a term used frequently by participants that involved the physicality of meeting in person and the temporality of convening on multiple occasions over time. Amelia described her experience as “repeatedly meeting up with someone”. Sarah explained her experience as “going out with someone every so often”. The intention was also an essential factor, with Sarah depicting her experience as “doing things with the person, hoping it would lead to something else”. Participants did not describe themselves as dating nor did they identify an alternate word when asked. For the purposes of the interview, “dating” was used to represent their unnamed occupation.

### Form
Dating is a dynamic phenomenon whose form is shaped by temporal, cultural, physical and virtual contexts.

*Temporal context*
Participants described dating in relation to time. Participants felt that dating for past generations was a more straightforward process with fewer options. Isabel mentions her mother’s relationship history:

>> And I think that’s part of her generation as well. You had a relationship, got married, had kids, and when you were done, you were done [...] she has never had the opportunity or the freedom. Back in her day, if you went on multiple dates regularly, you were a slut, and nobody wanted to date you. (Isabel)

The form of dating also evolved over the participant’s lifetime. They shared that in their teenage years, they socialised with mixed groups of friends in shared spaces such as a park or teenage disco. In college, dating remained informal, with groups of people meeting at parties or college activities. As they approached their thirties, dating became more serious, with some pressure around finding someone with more potential for a long-term commitment. Cathy shared, “When I was younger, dating was just for fun whereas now it is more that I’m not doing this for fun; I want it to be serious and turn into something”.

*Cultural context*
Dating in Ireland is deeply entrenched with traditional gender expectations. Allison and Claire referred to gender “rules” that can be helpful if you don’t want to be too forward or appear desperate. Because of the changing nature of dating, the “rule book” is confusing:

>> I think there are rules for both genders, but I do think that it’s expected that, for girls, the guys should be making more of an effort. There definitely is a whole rule section that I don’t understand, like the timing of texts. It’s been an hour, and you should not text back straight away. You should leave it. (Claire)

Participants could decide to break these gender rules but subtly demonstrate that they are flexible and open to change:

>> I do break the rules sometimes say depending, but I probably wouldn’t message a guy and say, ‘oh do you want to meet again?’ or whatever, but I may text them, let’s see if they said they had something on. (Allison)

Dating comes with uncertainty, in particular uncertainty around gender norms.

*Physical and virtual context*
Modern dating is performed in physical and virtual environments, though not always simultaneously:

>> I’m on POF [Plenty of Fish] now. I suppose it’s online now for the moment, but I’m just going to see and [...] it might happen that the guy I meet would be online [...] or if I met someone through a hobby or through work or whatever, it would probably nearly be better or it might not though. (Allison)

Participants might prefer one method over the other, but for most, it is a mixture. Marie stated, “So I joined up in September to Plenty of Fish and to Tinder as well; they would be the main tools and then just out and about.” Using both online apps and going to social spaces to meet people can be a strategy used for different purposes. Anna stated, “I went on it [Tinder] purely for the reason of meeting people outside my comfort zone [...] to widen my social circle a little bit”.

### Meaning
Meaning involves the beliefs and subjective experience that influence the way participants engaged in “dating”. Participants experienced tension between beliefs and fluctuation of emotions, to which they adapted by finding coping strategies and becoming more resilient.

*Beliefs*
Participants simultaneously held two beliefs to varying degrees: Dating is outside your control and has an element of fate, and dating is something you do have control over and you need to take a practical and proactive approach. The tension between beliefs was evident in their approach:

>> I don’t know maybe fate is telling me that ‘you can’t play a role in this, when the time is right for you to meet someone it will happen but then also there’s another part of me going, ‘well if you dated a little bit more your chances would increase so maybe you should give that a go’. (Claire)

Deciding on a partner entailed a balance between both allowing attraction to determine their partner and practical elements. Cathy expressed how feeling an attraction was necessary to move forward with someone, “But I wasn’t attracted to them [...]. And he kept pushing for it and I just felt nothing for him. I thought oh this is getting awkward”. Participants described feelings of attraction or “clicking” with someone, as an emotional signal that it was a good match. When asked if she believed in “the one”, Anna stated, “Yes, I do. some part of me does, that there will be one person that it clicks with, you feel at ease”. Others had practical requirements, including significant “deal-breakers” when deciding on an ideal partner, including profession (“not a farmer” [Betty], employed), lifestyle (nonsmoker), location, personality (not a “weirdo” [Cathy], “good manners” [Allison], “courteous and not so rude” [Allison]), religion, height and whether they were looking for sex or a relationship. Participants felt it was helpful to have dealbreakers yet be open-minded with someone:

>> I suppose a feeling more than anything I don’t have a list sitting here thinking, oh he has to have this job or he has to drive this car, that’s not the way that I will be at all. That’s not the value that I put on this but someone that you click with someone that I actually, who I have feelings for basically. (Amelia)

*Emotions*
Dating left the participants riding the highs and lows of emotion, changing how dating was approached and performed.

    *Mortified*. The assumption that people who date online are unable to attract a partner in person was a noticeable stigma. Strategies to avoid being discovered included using pseudonyms (Anna), removing profile pictures (Anna, Cathy) and lying to friends about being online to avoid judgement (Claire). Some participants believed that others would see them as desperate if they were online and it would send a message that they were unable to meet someone naturally:

>> I would be kinda embarrassed in a way [...] It’s like you need help to get it [...] yeah, some technology to find somebody for you as opposed to met in a bar, it’s like and happened naturally. (Betty)

Other participants acknowledged the stigma but felt that it is improving with more people being online. Anna mentioned that “Everybody’s on it now. It was kinda like a stigma [...] but if everybody knows about it, it seems to be normalising”.

    *Emotional Rollercoaster.* Participants described emotional highs and lows when dating. Some shared the excitement of meeting someone new, the “butterflies” (Amelia) they felt and how it was nice to have “someone finding me attractive” (Cathy). Dating was also vulnerable and involved “more of an emotional thing [...] It’s high stakes of it like I’m actually putting in effort putting myself out there” (Amelia). Dating involved a variety of emotional experiences, including: “overthinking everything” (Allison), “waiting and waiting and worrying” (Allison), “mind games” (Betty) and “personal torture” (Betty). Feelings could be hurt when they weren’t reciprocated, as Betty shared her experience of “the rollercoaster where only one person is interested or like the person just disappears”.

    *Resilience*. Dating impacted the emotional health of participants, but they used strategies to improve resilience, such as taking a break from dating or using positive self-talk:

>> A little bit of confidence doesn’t go astray, so like for me, I know I have to consciously psych myself up to go and be like, ‘look, what’s the worst that can happen? You can always leave’. You know all these things that I kind of reassure myself with before I go. (Claire)

The emotional impact of dating changes the person. Participants felt that they became more resilient and gained confidence over time while still experiencing emotional vulnerability:

>> I think it’s your self-esteem how you cope because, at the end of the day, you reject people, and you get rejected, and that’s all fine [...]. It’s normal, but it’s just how you perceive it, so I suppose it’s more to do with your confidence. I’m definitely better now than I would’ve been years ago because I’m definitely more confident, but I would still be nervous going on dates and stuff because there is that attachment of vulnerability. (Amelia)

### Function
The function involves the participants’ purpose for engaging in dating. Dating was a means to an end, with the aim to meet a partner. Dating also provided time and space to make an informed decision. Marie shared, “It’s nice to have the discovery phase and you know, but also, I wouldn’t like somebody to take that from me. I like to choose my own.”

When envisioning the outcome of dating, participants had different opinions regarding partnership. Allison and Sarah mentioned marriage, while the other participants had a range of acceptable partnerships:

>> I’m the kind of person who doesn’t want to get married, but I wouldn’t mind a partnership for a couple of years, then maybe something else, but I do like the concept of growing with somebody. That’s what drives me. I know how good it is when it is good. I know how shit it is because boys are pretty shit, but when it’s good, it’s really good. (Isabel)

The majority indicated their desire to share their everyday life with someone. Dating is an occupation to enable them to find a partner with whom to share their life and occupations: an occupational partner. Anna shared:

>> I don’t necessarily believe in marriage or monogamy, and I don’t see it as the be-all and end-all [...] I do want a partner. I want somebody to share things with. I want someone to go and have dinner with.

Their potential partner can participate in occupations with them so that they don’t have to go alone. “It would be nice to have someone in your corner in a way [...] so you could go to things that other people don’t wanna go to” (Betty). Having a partner also opened up the possibility of engaging in everyday occupations and planning for future occupations. “I want someone to grow with for a couple of years, someone to make plans with. I’d like to travel. I want someone to kind of share the bills with, save for the holidays, that kind of stuff” (Isabel).

The function of dating is to give time and space to figure out who would be a good partner. It is also seen as a means to an end, to find a partner whom you can engage in occupations with, a partner in occupation.
